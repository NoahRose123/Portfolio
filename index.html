                <p>I care about building software that works reliably and solves real problems. I'm not interested in hype or flashy demos that fall apart under real use.</p>
                <p>Good software should be clear, maintainable, and actually useful. I focus on understanding systems deeply rather than chasing trends.</p>
                <p>I believe in shipping working products, iterating based on real feedback, and learning by building.</p>
